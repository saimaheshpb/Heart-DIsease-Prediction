Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Approach
Heart Disease (including Coronary Heart Disease, Hypertension, and Stroke) remains the No. 1 cause of death in the US.The Heart Disease and Stroke Statisticsâ€”2019 Update from the American Heart Association indicates that:

116.4 million, or 46% of US adults are estimated to have hypertension. These are findings related to the new 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines.
On average, someone dies of CVD every 38 seconds. About 2,303 deaths from CVD each day, based on 2016 data.
On average, someone dies of a stroke every 3.70 minutes. About 389.4 deaths from stroke each day, based on 2016 data.
In this notebook i will try to unleash useful insights using this heart disease datasets and by building stacked ensemble model by combining the power of best performing machine learning algorithms.

This notebook is divided into 13 major steps which are as follows:
